    <p>Lyrics: Yeah!
Baby, how many times somebody told you "come, let's get away from here"<br>
I've got what you need, a brush for your teeth and a little bit of insaneness <br>
Yeah!<br>
Whenever you feel alone, I'll be there but you're never ever by my side <br>
Cause every time I see you my heart gones tick tick boom like dynamite <br>
Uh huh! <br>
And all them girls wanna be like her <br>
Uh huh! <br>
But believe me I don't see them girls <br>
Hey yo! <br>
And I think it's just because I'm so in love, so when I dream don't wake me up <br>
Sometimes I only dream of you <br>
Tell me what do I have to do, that you belong to me <br>
I would do anything for you <br>
‘Cause you've got what I need <br>
Baby come with me <br>
I'm feeling so alone, don't know what to do <br>
And no matter where I go I just think of you <br>
But all I really wanna know is how to make you mine <br>
Baby, let me know if you're alive <br>
Every day, another state, I am away on the plane <br>
But I got a problem girl <br>
‘Cause they don't love me <br>
But my money is the same all around the world <br>
Let me know, let me know, let me know, let me know baby girl that you exist <br>
‘Cause if not, I'm gonna a-a-act a fool like Ludacris <br>
Uh hu! <br>
‘Cause baby you're the only one for me <br>
Uh hu! <br>
Come and let me by your company <br>
Hey, yo! <br>
And I think it's just because I'm so in love, so when I dream don't wake me up <br>
Sometimes I only dream of you <br>
Tell me what do I have to do, that you belong to me <br>
I would do anything for you <br>
‘Cause you've got what I need, baby come with me  <br>
I'm feeling so alone, I don't know what to do <br>
And no matter where I go, I just think of you <br>
But all I really want to know is how to make you mine <br>
Baby, let me know if you're alive <br>
And I don't know what she is doing <br>
Baby, don't know where you are <br>
I feel alone an everyday I ask myself if you're alive <br>
And every hour I'm thinking about you just to get by <br>
Just because I'm so in love don't wake me up <br>
Don't wake me up <br>
Sometimes I only dream of you <br>
Tell me what do I have to do, that you belong to me <br>
I would do anything for you <br>
‘Cause you've got what I need, baby come with me  <br>
I'm feeling so alone, don't know what to do <br>
And no matter where I go, I just think of you <br>
But all I really want to know is how to make you mine <br>
Baby, let me know if you're alive</p>
