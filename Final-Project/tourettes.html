          <p>Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination.  Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue. Both men and women can have Parkinson’s disease. However, the disease affects about 50 percent more men than women. One clear risk factor for Parkinson's is age. Although most people with Parkinson’s first develop the disease at about age 60, about 5 to 10 percent of people with Parkinson's have "early-onset" disease, which begins before the age of 50. Early-onset forms of Parkinson's are often, but not always, inherited, and some forms have been linked to specific gene mutations. Parkinson’s disease occurs when nerve cells in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain that controls movement, become impaired and/or die. Normally, these nerve cells, or neurons, produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. When the neurons die or become impaired, they produce less dopamine, which causes the movement problems of Parkinson's. Scientists still do not know what causes cells that produce dopamine to die.People with Parkinson's also lose the nerve endings that produce norepinephrine, the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, which controls many functions of the body, such as heart rate and blood pressure. The loss of norepinephrine might help explain some of the non-movement features of Parkinson's, such as fatigue, irregular blood pressure, decreased movement of food through the digestive tract, and sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a sitting or lying-down position. Many brain cells of people with Parkinson's contain Lewy bodies, unusual clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein. Scientists are trying to better understand the normal and abnormal functions of alpha-synuclein and its relationship to genetic mutations that impact Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia.</p>
          <p>In computing and Internet use, accessibility describes whether a website, item of computing equipment or environment allows people with disabilities to gain access to it. The increasing use of mobile devices that are capable of interacting with the web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) accessibility standards/guidelines now include mobile accessibility. It address a wide range of issues, including. Legislation in many countries often defines a lack of accessibility as discrimination and provides guidelines to help companies design products, devices and services to be compliant.  All good websites should follow agreed accessibility guidelines which ensure that the content can be read without or without assistive technologies, for example, text styles, sizes and colours that are designed to legible even if have problems with your sight. In computing, accessibility provides features that make the technology easier to use, for example larger keys on keyboards or screen-reading software for audible interpretation of what is presented on the screen. An occupational therapist may be able to advise on this and give you recommendations on where you can purchase suitable equipment or adapt existing equipment to suit your needs. He or she may suggest simple adjustments to your environment and usage habits, such as better posture, chair height, or changing the distance from your keyboard to your monitor, to make it easier to use a computer safely. You may find it useful to talk to other people affected by Parkinson’s. They may tell you what equipment or websites they have they found helpful. Keyboards can be adjusted to help meet your needs. Filter Keys or Slow Keys ‘tune’ your keyboard, so the length of time a key needs to be held down for before it appears or repeats on screen can be changed. Sticky Keys allow you to operate a combination of keys using just one finger. Keyboards are available that can be pre-programmed with combination keys and shortcuts. You may find a key guard useful. This is a rigid plate with holes positioned over each key on your keyboard. The guard makes it impossible to press two keys at once. You can rest your hands and arms on the guard without pressing any keys. You can also buy keyboards with larger keys or that are colour-coded, which can be useful if you find it difficult to accurately find or press keys on a standard keyboard. With many mobile devices, accessibility controls are now built-in to the operating system. These include, captioning and Audio Descriptions allowing users to configure captions and audio descriptions during video playback. Display Customization – a range of features to customize the display, including Bold Text, High Contrast Cursors, Reduce Transparency, Dark Mode, and Reduce Motion. Speech – allowing devices to read selected text from your app out loud in multiple languages, and you can adjust the voice’s dialect and speaking rate. VoiceOver – a screen reader that interacts with objects in your apps so users can drive the interface even if they can’t see it. Guided Access – helping people with autism or other attention and sensory challenges stay focused on the task at hand. The mouse or touchpad is the device typically used to control the pointer or cursor displayed on a computer screen.  You may find using a mouse or a touchpad difficult, particularly if you have tremor or stiffness. It is possible to adjust the way your mouse or touchpad behaves by adjusting settings on the computer or by installing software specially designed to adapt the behaviour of the device to compensate for tremor. This includes changing the speed and/or sensitivity of your movements to give you more time when double clicking, slowing down the cursor on the screen or providing visual cues as to where the cursor is moving. In some cases, you might find it useful to replace your mouse with a ‘rollerball’ mouse. This is a static device with a large ball on top, which can be moved using your fingers, thumbs and palms, and can offer more control. Today, touchscreen and voice enabled technology allows you to directly control your computer without using a mouse at all. Voice recognition or dictation software converts the words you say into text or commands. This can be useful if you have problems typing or using a mouse. You can dictate text, navigate around your computer and use the Internet using voice commands. Teaching the computer software to recognise your voice can take time and patience but once mastered this it can be very helpful. Some people find using a combination of a keyboard, a mouse and voice recognition software for different tasks suits them best. Increasingly, computer operating systems also have built-in text to speech capabilities which means that content can be read to you. This can be very helpful if you have difficulty reading or have problems with your sight. Many computers offer a variety of voices that are fluent in different languages.</p>
