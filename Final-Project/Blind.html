    <p class="behind">"We've even been told by businesses before that they understand, but the fact is blind people are not a very big market," Mr Danielson says. "That's what we are dealing with." -Chris Danielson, a representative with the National Federation of the Blind
      Website accessibility lawsuits hit a record high in 2018, with retail being the most frequently targeted industry. More lawsuits were filed in court in the first six months of 2018 (1,053) than in all of 2017 (814), according to the NRF. The likes of Visa and Target have lost such lawsuits, and earlier this year a class-action was filed against Beyoncé's official website, alleging that Beyonce.com violates the ADA by denying visually impaired users equal access to its products and services. Ultimately, those pushing for digital accessibility argue that businesses have no excuse for dragging their feet over it.</p>

      <h1>The Use of The Internet</h1>
      <p>Globally there are millions of visually impaired people, constantly growing in numbers due to aging baby-boomers. The Internet can be of great value to blind people as it empowers them to independently complete tasks which they would normally not be able to accomplish without help from others (such as reading mail or managing bank accounts). Traditionally, blind people have been dependent on written information that has been translated into braille or audio books, which often take time to be produced. Through the Internet, new information (such as newspaper articles) is available immediately without delay.</p>

      <p class="tSize">Screen readers have been around for more than 30 years. A screen reader is a program that analyzes the layout and content of a website and provides a text to speech translation. The playback speed can be set by the user and commands allow them to skip from heading to heading, click links, and do other important tasks. Much like how a sighted person can visually skim a website to find the section they want to read, a person who is blind can do the same with their screen reader—as long as the website’s content has been coded with proper header tags.</p>
