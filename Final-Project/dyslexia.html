      <h1>Dyslexia</h1>
      <div class="sizing">
      <p id="fu">Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects your ability to read, spell, write, and speak. Kids who have it are often smart and hardworking, but they have trouble connecting the letters they see to the sounds those letters make. About 5% to 10% of Americans have some symptoms of dyslexia, such as slow reading, trouble spelling, or mixing up words. Adults can have this learning disorder, as well. Some people are diagnosed early in life. Others don't realize they have dyslexia until they get older. Kids with dyslexia often have normal vision and are just as smart as their peers. But they struggle more in school because it takes them longer to read. Trouble processing words can also make it hard to spell, write, and speak clearly. It’s linked to genes, which is why the condition often runs in families. You're more likely to have dyslexia if your parents, siblings, or other family members have it. The condition stems from differences in parts of the brain that process language. Imaging scans in people with dyslexia show that areas of the brain that should be active when a person reads don't work properly. When children learn to read, they first figure out what sound each letter makes. For example, "B" makes a "buh" sound. "M" makes an "em" sound. Then, they learn how to put those sounds in order to form words ("C-A-T" spells "cat”). Finally, they have to figure out what words mean ("Cat" is a furry animal that meows). For kids who have dyslexia, the brain has a hard time connecting letters to the sounds they make, and then blending those sounds into words. So to someone with dyslexia, the word "cat" might read as "tac." Because of these mix-ups, reading can be a slow and difficult process. Dyslexia is different for everyone. Some people have a mild form that they eventually learn how to manage. Others have a little more trouble overcoming it. Even if children aren't able to fully outgrow dyslexia, they can still go to college and succeed in life.</p>

        <h1>Dyslexia and Technology</h1>
        <p id="DT">Try as you might, if you don’t have dyslexia, it’s probably hard to really understand what it’s like for someone who does to use the Internet, where text is king. The characters twist themselves backwards and upside-down, morphing on the screen as you desperately try to make sense of them. These challenges are compounded by the fact that, when you have dyslexia, you often don’t know that you have dyslexia. Changing the physical appearance of text can make it easier for people with dyslexia to read. Many dyslexic people are sensitive to the glare of the white background on a page, whiteboard or computer screen. This can make the reading of text much harder. The use of a coloured background or coloured filters can make reading more comfortable.

Text-to-speech software reads text from a computer screen and is an efficient way to get information from text without reading it. Text-to-speech software is also a good way to proofread as incorrect words or spellings are often more obvious when heard. You can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to scan typed or printed documents into text that your device can read. There are also many apps available for smartphones that can take a picture of a page and perform OCR to create a text version of the page which can then be spoken out and/or saved. Reading pens are about the size of a marker pen and can scan over a printed document and have it read aloud through a built-in speaker or headphones. Most reading pens also have an inbuilt dictionary so you can hear the definitions of words.</p>
